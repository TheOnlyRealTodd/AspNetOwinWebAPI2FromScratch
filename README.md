# AspNetOwinWebAPI2FromScratch
In this project, I am setting up a Web API 2 from a blank project entirely from scratch... No MS scaffolding used. The files are clearly documenting with what everything does so that one can learn the system.
This API very basic but it is fully functional. The only thing is, you will want to set up HTTPS for a real-world production usage, and also you will need a web.config file. I left mine out for security reasons with the tokens.
